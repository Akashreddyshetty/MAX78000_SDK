## Description

A simple DMA transaction is shown that copies a block of memory from one location to another.

A second more complex memory-to-memory DMA transaction is then shown that chains two transfers together.  A callback function is used to notify the application once both transfers have completed.

## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect pins 1 and 2 (P0_1) of the JH1 (UART 0 EN) header.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
***** DMA Example *****
Transfer from memory to memory.
Data verified.

Transfer with Reload and Callback.
Data verified.

Example Succeeded
```
