## Description

This example configures the SPI to send data between the MISO (P0.22) and
MOSI (P0.21) pins.  Connect these two pins together.

Multiple word sizes (2 through 16 bits) are demonstrated.

By default, the example performs blocking SPI transactions.  To switch to non-blocking (asynchronous) transactions, undefine the MASTERSYNC macro and define the MASTERASYNC macro.  To use DMA transactions, define the MASTERDMA macro instead.

## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect pins 1 and 2 (P0_1) of the JH1 (UART 0 EN) header.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
-   Connect pins 14 and 15 of J4 (Camera) together.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
